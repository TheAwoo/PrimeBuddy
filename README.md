# PrimeBuddy

## What's this?

_PrimeBuddy_ is a piece of helper software designed to enchance your prime relic runs while playing WARFRAME. The program offers a simple list of prime items that you've obtained.

## Usage

Using _PrimeBuddy_ is as simple as taking a screenshot (default: F6) of the reward screen once you've decided on what you're taking with you. The screenshot is then ran through an OCR module configured especially for this task. The program also keeps a log of your drops in a text file.

## Limitations

 * _This_ version of the program is currently hardcoded to analyze 1080p screenshots
 * _PrimeBuddy_ works with WARFRAME's screenshots only, meaning you **cannot** use steam pictures
 * Some letters tend to get confused
